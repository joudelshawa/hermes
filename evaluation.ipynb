      "Alright, so I've got this task where I need to convert some unstructured clinical notes into a structured report following a specific format. The user has provided both the raw notes and the desired format, which ends with a sample output. My job is to understand how to approach this correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll start by carefully reading through the unstructured notes to identify all relevant patient information. The notes include details about the patient's admission, history, lab results, imaging, medications, and discharge plans. It's important to extract each piece of data accurately without missing anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to map this extracted information into the given structured format. This means going through each section like Administrative Details, SOAP notes, Discharge Conditions, etc., and populating them with the corresponding data from the raw notes. If any information is missing in the raw notes, I should leave those sections blank as per the user's instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to pay attention to specific sections within the format, such as the Review of Systems or Physical Examination, which have multiple subsections. These require careful extraction and placement without adding any extra headings or skipping parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the user emphasized not summarizing and strictly following the format, I'll ensure that each entry is a direct transfer from the notes without any rewording unless it's necessary for clarity. However, if the information isn't present in the raw data, those fields must remain empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also be cautious about handling medical terminology correctly to maintain accuracy. For example, making sure lab values are entered under the correct sections and that diagnoses are properly listed under both Assessment and Discharge Conditions as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after populating all possible fields, I'll review the entire structured report to ensure it aligns perfectly with the provided format, checking for any missing or misplaced information.
