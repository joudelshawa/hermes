History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of factor VIII deficiency who 
presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident. 
The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of 
consciousness on ___. He was initially seen at 
___ where CT imaging of head/neck showed no 
intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right 
platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active 
contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also 
developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain 
films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by ___ 
Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII 
assay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his 
hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on ___ to 11.6 on ___. 
Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The 
patient saw his hematologist on ___ and was found to have a 
hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the 
patient followed up with his PCP ___ ___ at which time his 
hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank 
hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal 
bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally 
intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or 
palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of 
the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder ___ 
resting, ___ moving), though this has improved over the course 
of the week.  
In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA. 
Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was 
9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 
103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage 
along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary 
read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. ___, was 
contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 
0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher 
management.  
Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant 
bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. 
Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. 
He was tested and found to have ___ disease. Later, 
after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late 
(e.g. ___ days later) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The 
patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the 
___ and was diagnosed 
with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on 
multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been as 
low as ~50.  
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without 
complaint.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
 
___ CT A/P
Acute hemorrhage along right posterior flank musculature and 
probably layering over it, only partly imaged and hard to 
distinguish musculature from hemorrhage. No active extravasation 
seen. Probable old hematoma along posterior left flank. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of mild FVIII deficiency who 
presents after snowboarding accident with multiple hematomas and 
falling hemoglobin concerning for ongoing bleeding.

# FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY, MULTIPLE HEMATOMAS: Patient presented 
after recent snowboarding accident. At ___ 
___, imaging was notable for neck and shoulder hematomas. 
Upon reevaluation by his PCP, the patient was found to have a 
flank hematoma. Given falling hemoglobin, there was concern for 
retroperitoneal bleed. CTAP in the ED demonstrated hematoma over 
his flank musculature, but no active extravasation. He was given 
IV DDAVP, but FVIII activity was 103 (wnl). CBC remained stable 
and patient declined further inpatient monitoring. Atrius 
hematology recommended continued outpatient hemoglobin 
monitoring, but did not think further DDAVP was indicated given 
normal FVIII level.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted with bruising on your right 
side and low blood counts after a snowboarding fall. With your 
history of hemophilia, it was important to evaluate internal 
bleeding which did show a right muscular flank blood collection. 
Your facotr VIII level was 103 and you received IV DDAVP under 
our care. Your blood counts were stable to improved on the day 
of admission. 

It is important that you not participate in any dangerous 
activities given your recent bleed and your hemophilia. Bleeding 
in hemophiliacs has more potential to be life-threatening.

Please get your blood counts checked at ___ site on either 
___ or ___. Follow up with your 
regular doctor early next week.

Best wishes,
Your ___ Care Team
