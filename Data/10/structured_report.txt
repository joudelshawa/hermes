**Case Analysis: Ascites in a Patient with HCV Cirrhosis**

**Patient Overview:**
- A 52-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis, HIV on ART, COPD, bipolar disorder, and PTSD presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal distension and confusion.

**Hospital Course:**
- **Diagnosis:** Ascites due to portal hypertension from HCV cirrhosis.
- **ED Evaluation:** Ultrasound revealed nodular liver, signs of portal hypertension (ascites, splenomegaly), cholelithiasis, and patent portal veins. Paracentesis was initially unsuccessful in the ED but performed later on the floor.

**Treatment:**
- **Diuretics:** Furosemide 40 mg PO daily and spironolactone 50 mg due to potassium level of 4.5, avoiding higher spironolactone dose for safety.
- **Paracentesis:** Removed 1.5L fluid post-admission, aiding in symptom relief.

**Contributing Factors:**
- Non-compliance with medications and diet likely contributed to ascites exacerbation.
- Consideration of potential drug interactions from HIV treatment was noted.

**Discharge Status:**
- Patient discharged home with clear mental status, alert, and ambulatory.

**Follow-Up and Management:**
- Emphasis on low sodium diet and strict medication adherence.
- Scheduled follow-ups with PCP and liver clinic for EGD and colonoscopy.

**Considerations:**
- Monitoring potassium levels due to spironolactone use.
- Potential recurrence of ascites if compliance is not maintained.
- Initial confusion possibly related to transient causes rather than hepatic encephalopathy or diuretic effects.

**Conclusion:**
The treatment approach with diuretics and paracentesis was appropriate. Key areas for future management include patient education, monitoring, and ensuring adherence to prescribed therapies to prevent ascites recurrence.
