    {
        "Question": "Is there a connection between the patient's non-compliance and ascites progression?",
        "Answer": "Yes, non-compliance with prescribed diuretics and low-sodium diet led to worsening ascites."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the primary reason for the patient\u2019s ascites from portal hypertension?",
        "Answer": "The primary reason is likely due to liver disease as indicated by imaging findings."

    {
        "Question": "How did discontinuing Furosemide and Spironolactone affect the patient\u2019s condition?",
        "Answer": "Discontinuing these medications led to worsening ascites symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the significance of nodular liver in this context?",
        "Answer": "Nodular liver suggests underlying liver disease contributing to portal hypertension."
    },
