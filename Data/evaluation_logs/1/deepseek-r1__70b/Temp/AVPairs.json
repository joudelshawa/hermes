    },
    {
        "Question": "Why did the patient's ascites worsen?",
        "Answer": "The ascites worsened due to non-compliance with diuretics and lack of dietary sodium restriction."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Did resuming medications improve the patient's condition?",
        "Answer": "Yes, after resuming Furosemide and Spironolactone, the patient lost excess fluid appropriately with stable electrolytes."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the relationship between non-compliance and ascites?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance with diuretics and sodium-restricted diet led to worsening ascites."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is portal hypertension linked to liver disease in this patient?",
        "Answer": "Yes, portal hypertension is a complication of the patient's HCV cirrhosis."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the key factors contributing to the patient's ascites?",
        "Answer": "Key factors include non-compliance with diuretics and sodium-restricted diet, along with underlying liver disease causing portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Did the patient experience any improvement after resuming treatment?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the patient showed improvement with appropriate fluid loss and stable electrolytes after restarting medications."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the significance of splenomegaly in this case?",
        "Answer": "Splenomegaly is a sign of portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does non-compliance affect the patient's condition?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance with medications and diet worsened ascites and hindered management of portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What imaging findings support the diagnosis of portal hypertension?",
        "Answer": "Imaging shows nodular liver, splenomegaly, and small amount of ascites, consistent with portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there a connection between the patient's non-compliance and ascites progression?",
        "Answer": "Yes, non-compliance with diuretics and diet directly contributed to the worsening of ascites."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the primary reason for the patient\u2019s ascites from portal hypertension?",
        "Answer": "The primary reason is underlying HCV cirrhosis leading to portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Did the patient discontinue any medications without medical advice?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the patient discontinued Furosemide and Spironolactone on her own without medical advice."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the prescribed treatments that the patient was non-compliant with?",
        "Answer": "The patient was non-compliant with Furosemide and Spironolactone, as well as a sodium-restricted diet."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How did discontinuing Furosemide and Spironolactone affect the patient\u2019s condition?",
        "Answer": "Discontinuation led to worsening ascites and abdominal distension due to unmanaged portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the significance of nodular liver in this context?",
        "Answer": "A nodular liver appearance on ultrasound is consistent with cirrhosis, contributing to portal hypertension and ascites."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there evidence that medication adherence improved the patient\u2019s condition?",
        "Answer": "Yes, resuming medications resulted in appropriate fluid loss and stable electrolytes, improving her condition."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the relationship between non-compliance and the progression of ascites?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance exacerbated the progression of ascites by allowing portal hypertension to worsen without treatment."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Did the patient have any imaging findings indicative of liver disease?",
        "Answer": "Yes, ultrasound showed a nodular liver compatible with cirrhosis and signs of portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the role of portal hypertension in the development of ascites?",
        "Answer": "Portal hypertension is the primary mechanism leading to ascites formation in this patient due to increased pressure in the portal vein system."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does non-compliance with medications impact the management of ascites?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance hinders effective management by allowing fluid retention and worsening symptoms, complicating treatment of ascites."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the consequences of discontinuing diuretics in this patient?",
        "Answer": "Discontinuation led to worsening ascites, increased abdominal distension, and discomfort due to uncontrolled fluid retention."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there a correlation between medication adherence and clinical improvement in this case?",
        "Answer": "Yes, improved adherence to prescribed diuretics correlated with clinical improvement as evidenced by fluid loss and stable electrolytes."
