    },
    {
        "Question": "Why are Furosemide and Spironolactone prescribed to the patient?",
        "Answer": "Furosemide and Spironolactone are prescribed to help reduce fluid retention and manage ascites by promoting diuresis."

    {
        "Question": "What are the potential consequences of non-compliance with diuretics in this patient?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance can lead to worsening ascites, increased abdominal distension, and potential complications from fluid overload."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does liver dysfunction manifest in this patient's lab results?",
        "Answer": "Liver dysfunction is evident through elevated ALT, AST, ALK phosphatase, total bilirubin, low albumin, and thrombocytopenia."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the significance of elevated ALT/AST in this patient?",
        "Answer": "Elevated ALT/AST indicates liver cell injury consistent with cirrhosis and ongoing liver damage."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is portal hypertension a concern for this patient?",
        "Answer": "Portal hypertension is a concern because it leads to complications such as ascites and splenomegaly, worsening the patient's condition."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the role of diuretics in managing ascites in this patient?",
        "Answer": "Diuretics help reduce fluid accumulation in the abdomen by increasing urine output, thereby managing ascites."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does non-compliance with medication affect the patient's condition?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance can worsen ascites and lead to increased fluid retention, exacerbating symptoms like abdominal distension and discomfort."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What lab findings are associated with liver dysfunction in this patient?",
        "Answer": "Lab findings include elevated ALT, AST, ALK phosphatase, total bilirubin, low albumin, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged INR."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is it important for the patient to comply with diuretic therapy?",
        "Answer": "Compliance is crucial as diuretics help reduce ascites and prevent complications from fluid overload and portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the names of the diuretics the patient is taking?",
        "Answer": "The patient is taking Furosemide and Spironolactone."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does portal hypertension contribute to ascites in this patient?",
        "Answer": "Portal hypertension increases pressure in the portal vein, leading to fluid leakage into the abdomen and causing ascites."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)?",
        "Answer": "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection of the ascitic fluid without any apparent source of infection, which can occur in patients with cirrhosis."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why are Furosemide and Spironolactone important for the patient?",
        "Answer": "They are important because they help manage ascites by promoting diuresis and reducing fluid retention in the abdomen."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the impact of non-compliance on the patient's treatment plan?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance can lead to ineffective management of ascites, worsening symptoms, and increased risk of complications from portal hypertension."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does liver dysfunction affect the patient's condition?",
        "Answer": "Liver dysfunction contributes to portal hypertension, leading to ascites and other complications that worsen the patient's overall condition."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the relationship between non-compliance and ascites management?",
        "Answer": "Non-compliance with diuretics directly impairs effective ascites management, leading to increased fluid retention and worsening symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why are lab results like ALT/AST important for this patient?",
        "Answer": "ALT/AST levels are important as they indicate the extent of liver damage and help monitor disease progression in cirrhosis."
