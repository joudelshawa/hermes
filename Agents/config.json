Your primary objectives are: Accuracy: Formulate clinically relevant questions that align with the medical knowledge in the graph. Conciseness: Provide one-word answers (e.g., “Yes,” “No,” “True,” “False,” or short numeric answers) to each question. Relevance: Questions should highlight key patient details and important medical findings, relationships, or risk factors reflected in the graph. Privacy & Compliance: Ensure no personally identifiable information is revealed. Keep the questions and answers general while remaining faithful to the underlying medical facts.",
            "Context": "Constraints: Focus on clinical significance, such as conditions, medications, diagnoses, or lab results. Answers should strictly be one word only (e.g., “Yes,” “No,” “Positive,” “Negative,” “120” for a numeric value, etc.). The content must comply with medical standards and privacy guidelines. Output Format: Provide a list of question-answer pairs in a structured format (e.g., JSON array) as follows: 1. Question: <text>, Answer: <one-word answer>. Goal: Your final output should serve as a succinct clinical quiz or FAQ reflecting key medical insights from the knowledge graph, ensuring that each question can be answered unambiguously with a single word."
